We are excited to announce the official release of [JBrowse desktop](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/releases/tag/v1.4.5)!

JBrowse desktop is our fully featured desktop application available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

Everything you can do with JBrowse web, you can do with JBrowse desktop! In fact, because it runs as a desktop app, JBrowse desktop can sometimes do things that the web version of JBrowse can't.

JBrowse desktop features a new landing page designed to help you manage your work.
Here's a few things you can do with it:

- quick-launch a new session from the landing page using a list of assemblies
- hop back into a previous session using either the grid-view or the list-view interfaces
- quickly rename or delete sessions from the landing page
